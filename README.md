# content-aware-image-resize
An implementation of the seam carving algorithm for content aware image resizing that I made for a Computer Vision class.
The paper can be seen here https://faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/imret.pdf <br/>
Use the reduceHeight function to reduce image to desired height and used reduceWidth to reduce image to desired width.
The implementation is not perfect but it should result in less distortion than just removing rows or columns of pixels
